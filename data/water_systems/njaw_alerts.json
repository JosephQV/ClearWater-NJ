The company requests that customers limit all nonessential water usage by pausing all outdoor watering until spring and conserving as much as possible indoors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are dedicated to responsible water management and are prepared to support Governor Murphy and the NJ DEP&rsquo;s action to move New Jersey to Drought Warning status,&rdquo; said Mark McDonough, president of New Jersey American Water. &ldquo;Our customers can trust that we are closely tracking water conditions and are prepared to take additional measures to support statewide water preservation efforts. However, it is critical for everyone to work together and conserve water now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In mid-October, the NJ DEP issued a Drought Watch following a prolonged period of low precipitation. The Watch was upgraded to a Warning as of November 13, following a public hearing to gauge the severity of water supply concerns.</p>\n<p>As a result of this public hearing and escalation, New Jersey American Water is urging customers to limit all non-essential water use and providing the following guidelines below:</p>\n<p><strong>Outdoor Conservation Guidelines:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pause all outdoor watering. </strong>Plants require less water in the fall, so allow them to go dormant for the season, and postpone water-intensive landscaping until spring.</li>\n<li><strong>Winterize your irrigation system. </strong>Turn off and drain sprinkler systems, outdoor spigots, and hoses.</li>\n<li><strong>Sweep, don&rsquo;t spray.</strong> Use a broom instead of a hose or pressure washer to clear leaves and debris from sidewalks or pavement.</li>\n<li><strong>Use a commercial car wash</strong> that recycles water, instead of washing your car at home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Indoor Conservation Guidelines:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Turn off the tap</strong> while brushing your teeth, shaving, or washing dishes in the sink.</li>\n<li><strong>Run dishwashers and clothes washers only when full</strong>. If you have a water-saver cycle, use it.</li>\n<li><strong>Take shorter showers</strong>. Try to shower in five minutes or less.</li>\n<li><strong>Be a leak detective.</strong> Find and fix leaks and breaks in hoses, sprinkler systems, pipes and toilets. For help, download New Jersey American Water&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.amwater.com/njaw/Water-Wastewater-Information/detecting-leaks\">Leak Detection Kit</a> at newjerseyamwater.com under Water Information.</li>\n<li><strong>Insulate exposed water pipes </strong>with pre-slit foam insulation to maintain warmth and avoid wasting water while it heats up.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider water and energy-efficient appliances.</strong> Products and services that have earned the US EPA WaterSense label have been certified to be at least 20 percent more efficient without sacrificing performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&ldquo;These small but impactful actions are designed to help alleviate stress on water sources and infrastructure. Together, we can make a difference and support the sustainability of our water resources,&rdquo; said McDonough.</p>\n<p>New Jersey American Water has been closely monitoring supply levels in coordination with operation centers across its system. The company does not anticipate a major threat to its water supply and is leveraging redundancies to shift between water sources to provide uninterrupted water service at this time. The DEP&rsquo;s Drought warning designation and New Jersey American Water&rsquo;s Mandatory Water Conservation Notice prioritize preserving available water supplies to avert a more serious water shortage.</p>\n<p>New Jersey American Water customers can monitor their water usage and find ways to use water more wisely online through their <a href=\"https://login.amwater.com/\">MyWater</a> account.

This is an essential part of our system maintenance program, which helps us to continue to provide you with high-quality water service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eXhzvgWr2CQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #1f63a7;\">WHY FLUSHING IS IMPORTANT</h3>\n<p>Flushing our system helps to clean out any build-up of mineral deposits and sediment inside the pipes. These deposits can occur when there is a reduced water demand. We also flush our hydrants to confirm they are operational and to check fire flows in our system.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #1f63a7;\">HOW WE FLUSH OUR PIPELINES</h3>\n<p>Flushing involves simultaneously opening fire hydrants in a specific area to create increased water flows. When our crews are on your street or nearby, this process usually takes about one hour.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #1f63a7;\">WHAT TO EXPECT</h3>\n<p>When crews are in your area, you may notice a drop in water pressure or discolored water. Discolored water may occur because the sediment in water mains gets stirred up when the fire hydrants are used and when the flow of water in mains changes. This is normal. If this happens, it is not harmful. Simply let your water run until it is clear.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #1f63a7;\">WHAT TO DO TO PREPARE FOR FLUSHING</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://login.amwater.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"/contentAsset/image/ce8a3546-189a-485b-a767-8bb9e046939d/fileAsset\" alt=\"sign up for alerts button.png\" width=\"274\" height=\"121\" data-field-name=\"fileAsset\" data-inode=\"56485ccc-3b87-4eee-af3c-23db2aed6cd7\" data-identifier=\"ce8a3546-189a-485b-a767-8bb9e046939d\" data-saveas=\"sign up for alerts button.png\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sign up for our customer notification system</strong> at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://login.amwater.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.mywater.amwater.com</a> to receive a call,&nbsp;text or email to let you know when we&rsquo;ll be flushing in your neighborhood.</li>\n<li>Draw water for cooking ahead of time.</li>\n<li>Store a large bottle of water in the refrigerator for drinking.</li>\n<li>Check for discolored water before using the washing machine or dishwasher.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"color: #1f63a7;\"><strong>ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER TIPS</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid running your tap water and using the washing machine or dishwasher while crews are flushing in your area.</li>\n<li>If discolored water occurs, simply run the cold water for a few minutes until it's clear. This will allow the sediment to work its way through your pipes.</li>\n<li>Check for discolored water before using the washing machine or dishwasher. Wait until the water runs clear at the tap before doing laundry or running the dishwasher. NOTE: If your laundry becomes stained,&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT PUT YOUR\u2008LAUNDRY IN THE DRYER.</strong>&nbsp;Rewash clothes immediately using detergent and add a rust remover. Most rust removers can also be used on stained fixtures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In some cases, slight discoloration might linger for a few hours. This discoloration only affects the appearance of the water and does not affect water quality. No health hazards are associated with discolored water from hydrant flushing. If water pressure or water volume seems low after flushing has been completed, check your faucet screens for trapped particles.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #1f63a7;\">HOW TO GET CUSTOMER NOTIFICATIONS</h3>\n<p>We will use our phone/text/email customer notification system to notify you before we begin flushing your neighborhood. <strong>You must opt-in to these types of non-emergency alerts.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log into MyWater, our customer portal, at <a href=\"https://login.amwater.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mywater.amwater.com</a>.</li>\n<li>On the Alert Settings tile, click on the Edit button, which will take you to the page where you can update your contact information and preferences.</li>\n<li><strong>Not an account holder?
