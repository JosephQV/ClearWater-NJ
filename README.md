To run the code, run this in the terminal:

python main.py

The main.py file creates the kivy App instance and loads the component widgets and screens from every other file. You do not need to replicate
anything from main.py in the files you work on.


For setting up your python environment in a directory and installing the needed packages, see the "environment_and_git_setup_commands.txt"
file in this repository. It also contains the commands needed for creating a new git branch and pushing your changes to it. Please ask about
this if you are confused.
